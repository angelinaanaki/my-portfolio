By measuring the time a key is held down (key hold duration) during normal typing and converting it into a PD motor index using regression algorithms, the system distinguishes between healthy individuals and those with early PD symptoms. The approach offers a non-invasive, low-cost way to support early diagnosis and monitoring, achieving 57% accuracy in tests with 43 participants."
